### Rad Video Tools

Rad Video Tools, made by Rad Game Tools, are the creators of the `.bk2` file format. These video files can only be opened using Rad Video Tools, which you can find [here](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm)


#### Converting Files

This tutorial is for **Windows**

Rad Video Tools can be downloaded from [http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm). You will also need 7zip, to extract the archive, which can be found here [https://www.7-zip.org/download.html](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

First, install 7zip by running the executable and following the installation instructions.

Next, navigate to your downloads folder and open the `RADTools.7z` file. A GUI might pop up asking you to select what program to open the file with. If "7-Zip File Manager" is an option select it and press OK

If it is not, select "More Apps", scroll to the bottom and select "Look for another app on this PC"

By default, this will open to `C:\Program Files` where, if you used the default option, the 7-Zip folder will be. In the folder, select `7zFM.exe`

When you open the archive and try to run `radtools.exe`, you will be prompted to enter a password. The password is "RAD" as stated on the website

This will open the RAD Video Tools installer. Once completed, navigate to the RAD Video Tools folder (default `C:\Program Files (x86)\RADVideo`) and run either `radvideo64.exe` or `radvideo32.exe`, depending on if you use a 64-bit or 32-bit operating system (it's likely 64-bit, but 32-bit should work on both types).

Use the drop down menu at the top to navigate to the videos folder (`{root}\data\resource_packs\badger\videos`) where you can either play the videos, by selecting and pressing play, or convert them

First, select the file(s) you wish to convert. To select multiple you can drag click over them or `shift` + `click` to select multiple. Then click "Convert a file" bottom left. If you have selected multiple, a dialogue will appear asking if you want to convert the files into individual files

Click yes and new dialogue will open. This is the same dialogue that will open when you convert just one file. By default, the converted files will be put into the same location as the original files. This can be changed by clicking "Browse…". Click "Output type…" to change what the file will be converted to

If you are converting one file, press "Convert". If you are converting multiple files, this is not an option so press "Batch" and the batch editor window will open. Press "Start" and the process will begin
