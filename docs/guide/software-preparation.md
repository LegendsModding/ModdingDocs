# Software and Preparation

Before you can start modding Legends, you first have to install the required tools and applications.

## Download Minecraft Legends

-   [Microsoft Store](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-legends)
-   [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928870/Minecraft_Legends/)

## Picking an Editor

Modding Legends can be done using any text editor, however it's much more comfortable to work in a dedicated editor. A good editor can give you code-completion, error-detection, and in-editor documentation.

### VSCode

VSCode is a general purpose text-editor and IDE. With VSCode, you will be able to edit your mods in plain-text, guided along by a powerful array of extensions and addons. VSCode is a great option for programmers and advanced users.

[⚙️Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Many packages exist for VSCode that make modding easier:

-   [.lang support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zz5840.minecraft-lang-colorizer)
-   [Prettify-json](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohsen1.prettify-json)
-   [Spell Checker (for writing wiki)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

-   [UUID Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netcorext.uuid-generator)

## Image Editors

When choosing an image editor, it is important to keep in mind that the traditional Minecraft style is composed of simple 16x16 pixelart. There are plenty of powerful and free art programs available for you to use. However, many of these programs have more tools than you will need for Minecraft graphical design and these tools require time to learn.

:::tip
Choose a program that feels comfortable and easy for you to use. Many Addon creators use different art programs for different tasks. (Example: One might use paint․net for most of the art, and piskel for Minecraft block animations). Choose what works best for you!
